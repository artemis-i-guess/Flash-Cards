# Flash-Cards

Introducing Flash Cards, the ultimate tool to help you during revisions. Be it SDE preparation or your SAT exams, or even you college SEM exams, use flash cards to revise everything you learnt in a short time and keep all your cards in an organised way. 

# Tools to be used: 
ReactJS, CSS, SQLlite , Python (Flask)

# App Skeleton
  There should be Navbar containing links to all pages and a login button and if logged in then user profile image and username.
  Body of the home page should be to add a card and there should be tags with radio buttons to add tags to the card so that it can be filtered.
  Page 2 of the app should be the memorisation interface where there should be the filter function to chose the small dataset from the     
  database, then the card itself , with the question on the upside . There should be 3 buttons -> Flip Card , Correct Answer , Next Card . 
  There should also be a counter to count the number of correct answers in a session. 

  This is the general idea of the app , open to customisation.

# RoadMap for Flash-Cards

## 1. Set up Database (SQLlite)
   Set up the database to store your information for every card created.
   As users create new cards, make all the information on the cards be structured as a query and store it in the database.
   For when user will view the card obtain the same from the database in a randomized order.
    
## 2. Backend Development
   Set up a flask backend to handle CRUD operations.

## 3. Designing the UI 
   Design the frontend in Figma and PR screenshots and the link to your Figma file. The best design will be chosen. The final dates for UI design will be given later on.

## 4. Frontend Development
   Design the frontend according to the UI chosen. This will be a React framework hence make suitable components,pages,routes.

## 5. Functionalities to add:
   Add OAuth 

## 6. Documentation and Maintenance
   Create and Maintain the project by addressing bug reports, feature requests, and potential enhancements and installation instructions,         usage guidelines and API documentation.
